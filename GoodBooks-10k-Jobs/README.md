## Target

The dataset is a books collection with some information as: ratings, bookmarks etc etc ...
You find it at this github repository: 

[Good books 10k repository](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k "GoodBooks repository")

## Jobs

The jobs the team had to develop are:

1. Find out the best 500 authors. In order to do that we had to compute the average rating

2.  Find out a correlation between bookmarks and rating. Bookmark is the desire for a user
to read a book. 

## Deploy

You can find the result of our works in the following directory:
